Changes Made to the coding

1. Changing <div class="header"> into <nav class="nav-bar">
    -Changing div to nav so the purpose of that part of coding is stated much clearer.
    -Changing class name from header to nav-bar, makes the coding in CSS more clear where those styles are applying.
    -Furthermore, avoiding using class name that is samee as default types name.

2. Create Classes "company-name", "nav-bar-links", "nav-bar-links-list", "nav-bar-links-list-item", "link-text"
    -Creating classes so it is easier to identify which part of the website the styles are applying to.

3. Changing <div> of class hero, content and benefits, to <section>
    -Changing to section makes it easier to identify codes for each different parts of the website.
